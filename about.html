            <p>The journey began in 1959, when Shri Biharilal Sethi & Family laid the foundation for a legacy in the glass industry. Over the decades, the family ventured into diverse segments of glass, building a reputation for quality and innovation.<br><br>
                In July 2015, this legacy was elevated by Shri Ramesh Sethi with over 50 years of experience, who founded BL TUFF GLASS with a clear vision: to deliver high-quality toughened glass to the market. Today, as we celebrate 10 glorious years, we proudly affirm that this vision has been realized.<br><br>
                From a modest 1,000 sq. yard property, BL TUFF GLASS has grown into a cutting-edge facility spread across 2 acres, featuring a 45,000 sq. ft. shop floor equipped with advanced glass processing machinery imported from China, Italy, and Germany.<br><br>
                We are proud to be an Authorised Co-Branded Processor for SAINT-GOBAIN, and the only ELITE processor in India. Our pioneering work in double and triple silver performance glass processing, backed by ISI Certification, is validated through Saint-Gobain's rigorous quality assurance protocols, ensuring unmatched product excellence.<br><br>
                This milestone is a tribute to our unwavering commitment to innovation, precision, and customer satisfaction. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our clients, partners, and dedicated team members who have been integral to this journey.
